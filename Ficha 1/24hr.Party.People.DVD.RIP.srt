1
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:34,505
Is it a bird? Is it a pIane?

2
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:37,846
No, it's the Iatest craze sweeping the Pennines.

3
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:41,479
I've got to be honest.
I'd rather be sweeping the Pennines right now.

4
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,115
You're supposed to have
three weeks' training for this.

5
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,421
<i>Granada Reports</i> don't have that kind of money.

6
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:49,985
So, I'm afraid I'm just gonna IiteraIIy
Iaunch myseIf off this mountain.

7
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:54,193
This is, very possibIy,
the Iate Tony WiIson for <i>Granada Reports</i>.

8
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,493
Wish me Iuck.

9
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:01,438
Just puII the bar in to get controI back again.

10
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,169
Hear it fIapping, it's okay.

11
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,835
If it stops, I'm in troubIe.

12
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:06,572
ExactIy. PuII it tiII it fIaps again.

13
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,910
One, two, three, go.

14
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:19,788
I'm fIying!

15
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:21,789
This is a physicaI...

16
00:01:22,262 --> 00:01:23,388
...high.

17
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:26,165
A physicaI, IegaI high.

18
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,779
This is the most amazing feeIing,
better than sex.

19
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:45,846
Forward, forward.

20
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:54,158
Oh, shit!

21
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:56,789
HeIp!

22
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,455
There's a barbed-wire fence.

23
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,032
Shit.

24
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:15,404
Fucking heII!

25
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,745
WeII, I'm battered...

26
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:20,518
...I'm bruised...

27
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:23,181
...I've done something rather unfortunate
to my coccyx...

28
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:26,282
...I'm sIightIy upset, and I'm utterIy eIated.

29
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,793
I'II definiteIy be doing it again.

30
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:32,161
This is Tony WiIson,
a shadow of his former seIf...

31
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,199
...for <i>Granada Reports</i>. Back to the studio.

32
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:38,664
Take care. I'II be in touch,
because it was so exciting.

33
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,433
-I'd Iove to do it again.
-No probIem.

34
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,065
Okay. Cheerio.

35
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:52,549
You're gonna be seeing a Iot more
of that sort of thing in the fiIm.

36
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,416
AII of that actuaIIy did happen.

37
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,956
ObviousIy, it's symboIic.
It works on both IeveIs.

38
00:02:57,023 --> 00:03:00,254
I don't want to teII you too much,
don't want to spoiI the fiIm.

39
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,023
But I'II just say ''Icarus.'' Okay?

40
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,859
Doesn't matter if you don't understand.

41
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,796
But you shouId probabIy read more.

42
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,806
-How's the birdman of Derbyshire?
-Not bad.

43
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:01,108
Love the hang-gIiding, mate. Loved it.

44
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,376
You see? What are you compIaining about?

45
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,782
He doesn't have to deaI
with the consequences of--

46
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,944
The consequences?

47
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,181
He won't contend with the possibiIity of death.

48
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:10,449
You're insured.

49
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:13,014
How's that supposed to be
of any comfort to me?

50
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:15,687
Look, I reaIize the danger invoIved.
I'II come up with--

51
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:19,596
Let me teII you, I'm not doing
any more kamikaze stuff, ever. That's it.

52
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:20,826
-HeIIo, Tony.
-HeIIo.

53
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,889
PauI, AIan.

54
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,663
I've got the tickets.

55
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:26,865
-AIan, did you see the hang-gIiding articIe?
-I did. WeII done.

56
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,101
Wasn't it briIIiant? We had peopIe phoning in.

57
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,268
-I know they did.
-It's what the pubIic want.

58
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:34,836
I know, but the pubIic, Iet me teII you,
Iike pubIic executions.

59
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:39,578
I went to Cambridge University, CharIes.
I'm a serious fucking journaIist...

60
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,986
...Iiving in one of the most important
fucking times of human history.

61
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:45,581
-There's no need to swear.
-I mean it.

62
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:49,451
<i>The Buzzcocks can't play,</i>
<i>because we're not ready.</i>

63
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,861
<i>So, it's just the Sex Pistols.</i>

64
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,688
June 4, 1976.

65
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:00,756
The Sex PistoIs pIay Manchester
for the very first time.

66
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,064
There are onIy 42 peopIe in the audience...

67
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:07,300
...but every singIe one of them
is feeding on a power, an energy and a magic.

68
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:10,809
Inspired, they wiII go out
and perform wondrous deeds.

69
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,107
For instance, Howard Devoto at the front...

70
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,908
...Pete SheIIey at the back...

71
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,910
...they organized this gig.

72
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,150
They're way ahead of everyone in Manchester.
They're aIready the Buzzcocks.

73
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,590
Howard Iater sIeeps with my wife.

74
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,362
Behind me are Stiff Kittens.

75
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,990
Soon to become Warsaw,
Iater to become Joy Division.

76
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,897
FinaIIy to become New Order.

77
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,098
Ginger-nut...

78
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,507
...Mick HucknaII.

79
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:54,442
That's John the Postman. He's a postman.

80
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:59,087
And that guy dancing at the front,
that's Martin Hannett...

81
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:02,593
...the onIy bona fide genius in this story.

82
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:07,230
One of the onIy two
bona fide geniuses in this story.

83
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:10,097
He wiII Iater try to kiII me.

84
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:51,776
<i>Good night, Manchester.</i>

85
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,471
<i>Thanks for your bullshit.</i>

86
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,129
Must go.

87
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,235
Not David.

88
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:21,972
He goes.

89
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:29,505
-What's wrong?
-These jeans, they're sort of....

90
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:31,209
They go right up me crotch.

91
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,944
Too tight for you, that's why.

92
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,079
I'm teIIing you,
they cut straight between my baIIs.

93
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,954
You're not a reguIar shape though, are you?

94
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,218
Pardon?

95
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,622
For jeans.

96
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,961
-What do you mean, I'm not a reguIar shape?
-You've got big hips.

97
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,602
-I've not got big hips.
-You have.

98
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,604
-I haven't.
-You've got huge hips for a man.

99
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:55,766
That's fucking ridicuIous.
I haven't big hips. Don't say that.

100
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:58,538
-You've got bigger hips than me.
-That's fucking buIIshit.

101
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,145
It's reaIIy good stuff, isn't it?

102
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:04,105
This is good. Where did you get it from?

103
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:07,080
Mate of mine brought it back from his hoIidays.

104
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:09,453
What, Caribbean?

105
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:11,349
RhyI.

106
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,218
The Sun Center in RhyI.

107
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:16,819
Right.

108
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,562
I wouId describe it as history.

109
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,571
How can it be history?
There were onIy 42 peopIe at the gig.

110
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,665
So what?
How many peopIe were at the Last Supper?

111
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:33,075
TweIve. Thirteen, incIuding Jesus.

112
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,340
-Have you recovered?
-Yeah.

113
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:37,144
-But it's not documented.
-In other words, not many.

114
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:39,582
How many peopIe
were at the murder of JuIius Caesar?

115
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:41,517
I don't know. You teII me.

116
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:42,645
Five.

117
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,349
Shut up, then.

118
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:47,492
I'm Tony WiIson.
Here we are, as we are, <i>So it Goes</i>.

119
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,791
On tonight's show,
I'II be taIking to AIice Cooper from the ApoIIo.

120
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:54,424
ApparentIy, he'II be hanging a dwarf,
Iive on stage.

121
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,401
But first,
two minutes of the most important music...

122
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,496
...since EIvis waIked into
the Sun Studios in Memphis.

123
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:04,339
The Sex PistoIs and <i>Anarchy in the UK</i>.

124
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,186
<i>in 1976...</i>

125
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:24,590
<i>...two or three people</i>
<i>controlled all the music on television.</i>

126
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,659
<i>And they didn't like punk.</i>

127
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:27,961
<i>For a year...</i>

128
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:31,367
<i>...if you wanted to see</i>
<i>the most exciting bands in the world...</i>

129
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:34,270
<i>...they were on a regional show</i>
<i>coming out of Manchester.</i>

130
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,837
<i>My show.</i>

131
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,419
The StrangIers. Amazing.

132
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,589
-CIass act, that.
-They're shit.

133
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,185
-They're a bunch of wankers.
-Language.

134
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,189
This is better.

135
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,126
This guy....

136
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:14,539
I fucking Iove this guy. This guy is fantastic.
Listen to that voice.

137
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:22,310
-Listen to him.
-Looks a bit homo, though, with that--

138
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:25,350
That's part of it.
The big handIebar, drop-handIe mustache.

139
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,113
-I don't know about that.
-BriIIiant.

140
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:33,958
The guy with the handIebar mustache,
that is KarI Denver.

141
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,654
This is Shaun Ryder, and that one is PauI.

142
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:40,529
Later, they become the Happy Mondays
and get KarI Denver to sing with them.

143
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,999
We'II be hearing more
from the Happy Mondays Iater.

144
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:55,377
But right now, I'm getting a IittIe bit tired
of just putting bands on teIevision...

145
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:58,474
...so I'm about to open a Iive music venue.

146
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,984
-Isn't it a bit of a dump?
-Not Las Vegas, is it?

147
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,852
Go round to the Ieft.

148
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,490
There's dog shite everywhere. It's disgusting.

149
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,018
It's urban. It's exciting.
It's exactIy the pIace we shouId be.

150
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,256
You don't think those kids'II nick the car,
do you?

151
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,028
They're not gonna nick the car.

152
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,566
Are you sure?

153
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:20,531
-Right, the reason we're here reaIIy is--
-Margaret?

154
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,434
Because of the expIosion in music,
with New Wave...

155
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,636
...there's Iots of exciting bands happening...

156
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:29,112
...and I think that, cuIturaIIy,
Manchester's sIightIy Iagging behind.

157
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:33,084
If you want to get into a nightcIub,
you've gotta dress Iike a hairdresser.

158
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,686
-The wife's a hairdresser.
-That's great.

159
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:39,623
But some peopIe aren't,
and they've got a right to dance and party.

160
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:40,750
I'm Tonay.

161
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,395
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Sorry, this is Tony.

162
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,390
Tonay doesn't beIieve in teIevision.

163
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:49,696
I was just saying, 'cause it's funny,
'cause Tony's on the teIIy.

164
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,499
You know what I caII teIevision? The idiot box.

165
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:55,766
-Idiot box.
-Yeah, there's a Iot of rubbish on.

166
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:57,866
Right, we spIit the door 60-40 to me.

167
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,811
The band, they get a crate of aIe.
You can have Fridays.

168
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,543
-Look round whiIe I do the tiII.
-Okay. Thank you.

169
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:12,424
-It stinks in here.
-There's a probIem.

170
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:15,720
You never toId me he was caIIed Tony.

171
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,020
Who?

172
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,358
What's up?

173
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:19,998
Tony. There's two Tonys.

174
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:24,368
Straightaway, that's a....

175
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,738
Can you not see how that's a potentiaI probIem?

176
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:29,240
He's in charge of the cIub.

177
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:31,708
I'm supposed to be in charge
of what we're doing.

178
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:34,610
There's two Tonys on equaI pegging.
There's a confrontation.

179
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,911
Who's Tony number one and two?
We need some sort of differentiation.

180
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:40,475
But he's not caIIed Tony, is he?

181
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:44,452
He's caIIed Tonay. You know, Don Tonay.

182
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,354
It's his fucking surname, Tone.

183
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,426
-Is it?
-Yeah.

184
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:50,188
It's a bit grubby.

185
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:53,790
I know it's grubby, but we can get it cIeaned up
for the nights we're in.

186
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:55,060
That's worse.

187
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,668
What is worse?

188
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:58,892
WeII....

189
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,933
I'm sorry to harp on about this,
but that makes him Mr. Tonay...

190
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,944
-...and I'm just pIain Tony.
-What's wrong with that?

191
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,112
There's a hierarchy there, straightaway.

192
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,978
''Mr. Tonay'' is more important than ''Tony.''

193
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,143
''HeIIo, Mr. Tonay. Yes, no, mister.''

194
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,551
And just pIain oId Tony.
''Tony, me mate, Tony....''

195
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,213
I've gotta have some credibiIity.

196
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,815
Why don't you just caII him Don?
How about that?

197
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,087
See if he goes for that. CaII him Don.

198
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,188
Don.

199
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,565
What kind of music
are you gonna be bringing in?

200
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:32,866
-Sort of New Wave.
-Kind of indie.

201
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,270
-Indian?
-No, indie.

202
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:37,969
Don't want any of that ska. I don't Iike that ska.

203
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:39,204
Okay.

204
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,145
Don't want that. A notion
I'II Ieave you with is heavy metaI.

205
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:45,308
Get one of them bands.
They drink Iike the fucking Queen Mother.

206
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:46,442
Right.

207
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,612
-Leave you with that.
-Nice car, Don.

208
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:49,950
She's thirsty.

209
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,450
See you, Don.

210
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,723
-I think the name thing went okay.
-He heard you that time.

211
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:58,024
I was gonna be a Don.

212
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:01,498
I was gonna be a VirgiI
tiII me mum Iost her bottIe at the Iast minute.

213
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:04,468
-He means he was gonna be a don.
-I went to Cambridge.

214
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,528
What about a name for the cIub?

215
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:08,800
CaII it ''Factory.''

216
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,938
-I Iike that. It's a bit Andy WarhoI.
-It's a bit L.S. Lowry.

217
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:16,311
I just saw a sign on the waII, said,
''Factory CIosing''...

218
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:20,375
...and I thought, we can have one going,
''Factory Opening.'' Reverse the trend.

219
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:28,657
MaI, when you come down to me, can you
make sure you just get a gIimpse of my boot?

220
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:32,223
If it's on-screen I get a cIothing aIIowance.

221
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,095
No probIem.

222
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:38,265
That is The CIash. This was <i>So it Goes</i>.

223
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:40,828
And, as it goes, so it went. It's aII over.

224
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:44,171
If you want to hear good music now,
you'II have to get off the couch.

225
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,804
Go down to the Factory night
at the RusseII CIub, every Friday.

226
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:51,842
Go forth and preach the gospeI. Good night.

227
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,417
There's quite a few. If they've started
Ietting them in, then that's a good crowd.

228
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:04,395
-Fucking cunt.
-Wanker.

229
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:06,522
-That's originaI.
-Like your hair.

230
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,397
-Fuck you.
-Why does he Iet peopIe taIk to him Iike that?

231
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:12,699
He doesn't care what they say,
as Iong as they're taIking about him.

232
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:13,932
You know that, AIan.

233
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,736
-Someone who Iikes me.
-I Iove you. Sign this for me?

234
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,800
-What's your name?
-John.

235
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,911
-HeIIo, Mark.
-Hi. AII right?

236
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,315
I reaIIy miss your program,
so, I thought to get it back on teIIy.

237
00:18:28,387 --> 00:18:30,878
-I've spoken to--
-He don't want it to come back.

238
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:34,392
He wants it to be gone forever,
so it can become a Iegend. Don't you?

239
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:38,192
There is a man with a grasp of semiotics.
There's your answer.

240
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:41,028
-Can I get you haIf a Iager?
-You can get me a pint.

241
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,292
Right, okay. Fine.

242
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,034
WiIson, you fucking cunt!

243
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,505
That's originaI.

244
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,838
Your drink's coming.

245
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,845
-Is he a friend of yours?
-He's our singer.

246
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:55,505
How are you, Steve?

247
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,475
Hi. Tony WiIson. PIeased to meet you.

248
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:03,352
Is he gonna hit me?

249
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:06,482
-You're quite cIose to me there.
-I know. I wanna be.

250
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:08,990
-Why?
-Because you're a cunt, mate.

251
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:11,256
I know, I heard you the first time.

252
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,272
You got to stop him singing.

253
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,770
It's avant-garde. You wouIdn't understand it.

254
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,441
He's very poor.

255
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,811
-It's provocative.
-ProvocativeIy poor.

256
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:38,216
AppaIIingIy poor.

257
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:43,762
They're not caIIing you the new George Epstein,
you know.

258
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:47,888
-It's Brian Epstein.
-George Epstein, BeatIes' manager.

259
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,197
-That's Brian Epstein, dickhead.
-George Epstein.

260
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,430
-It's fucking Brian Epstein.
-Brian Martin.

261
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:55,770
-It's not Brian, it's George Martin.
-Brian Martin, the producer--

262
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,536
-TeII him to fuck off.
-Let's sit down.

263
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,702
You're just fucking wrong.

264
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:14,215
<i>The introduction's not usually this long.</i>
<i>i think the singer's in the toilet.</i>

265
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,568
Where have you been, you twat?

266
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,029
-60-40 to you, we said, didn't we?
-Yeah. Smashing.

267
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,974
There's Pou1. Get yourseIf a drink. Come with me.

268
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:13,603
Come on, foIIow your UncIe Tonay.
Through here.

269
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,738
I don't do any coke.

270
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,042
Where are we going?

271
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:20,107
It's just that I've got...

272
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:21,379
...you know....

273
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:22,977
-Come on.
-What are we doing?

274
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:26,456
-Let's have a nosh to seaI the bargain.
-I've eaten actuaIIy, Don.

275
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,720
We're not gonna be eating, my friend.

276
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:31,291
When the Don's hungry, the Don eats.

277
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:33,626
HeIIo, girIs.

278
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:36,162
Your UncIe Don's here. Come on.

279
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:40,069
Jump in, Tony. Don't be shy. Come on.

280
00:22:40,472 --> 00:22:43,100
Come on, girIs. On your knees and eat.

281
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,274
-Where is he?
-Where's who, babe?

282
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:55,286
-Tony. I can't find him.
-I think he went outside with Don.

283
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,784
-Do you mind if I just put--
-Take it aII off.

284
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,192
-Is it okay if I just poke it through the side?
-No.

285
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:06,060
That's what I normaIIy do.

286
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,793
-I think it's too big for that.
-Come on, don't be shy.

287
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:11,665
-Is that what you do at home?
-That's what I do at home.

288
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,329
FeeI that. Just have a feeI.

289
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,830
That's nice, that, innit?

290
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:19,472
Do you mind if I touch your tits
whiIe you're doing it?

291
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,842
Thank you.

292
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:22,380
Go on.

293
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,371
Put that on your TV show.

294
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,864
Hey, shut the fucking door.

295
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,429
-It's not how it Iooks, Iove.
-Come in, Iove.

296
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:44,196
What are you doing, Tony?

297
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:47,738
It's not how it Iooks, aII right?
Don put me up to it.

298
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,741
I didn't know what I was doing.
He made me do it.

299
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,800
-It's not how it seems.
-Are you coming in?

300
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:57,338
-If you're not coming in, then fuck off.
-Leave it, that's my wife.

301
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,908
What are you doing, Tony?

302
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:01,844
That's my wife.

303
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:04,821
Listen, I Iove you.

304
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,759
Can you finish me off?

305
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:30,642
God bIess.

306
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:40,515
HeIIo.

307
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:42,152
Posters, Tony.

308
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:45,219
You've got the posters? This is the fucking gig.

309
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:47,390
I know. It took ages to get the right yeIIow.

310
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:48,626
The gig's over.

311
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,366
I know.

312
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:55,498
That's fucking great, actuaIIy.

313
00:24:56,408 --> 00:24:57,739
It's reaIIy nice.

314
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:00,011
It's beautifuI, but useIess.

315
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:03,941
And as WiIIiam Morris once said,
''Nothing useIess can be truIy beautifuI.''

316
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,851
-AII right, Tone?
-Yeah.

317
00:25:10,355 --> 00:25:12,846
-Heather, this is Tony WiIson.
-HeIIo, Iove.

318
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:15,326
Have you seen Lindsay?

319
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,859
She went off with Howard.

320
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,866
She just caught me
getting a bIow job off a hooker...

321
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,927
...in the back of a van.

322
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,835
I better go and get her.

323
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,822
Excuse me.

324
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,092
-Hi, Tony.
-Hi.

325
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:58,602
Have you got the car keys?

326
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:01,798
-In me bag.
-Thanks.

327
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,273
I onIy got a bIow job. That's fuII penetration.

328
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:12,183
-See you, Howard.
-See you, Tony.

329
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:14,978
AII right?

330
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,947
I definiteIy don't remember this happening.

331
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,727
<i>This is the real Howard Devoto.</i>

332
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:26,420
<i>He and Lindsay insisted we made clear</i>
<i>that this never happened.</i>

333
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,223
<i>But i agree with John Ford.</i>

334
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,235
<i>When you have to choose</i>
<i>between the truth and the legend...</i>

335
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,732
<i>...print the legend.</i>

336
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:36,063
I thought the name of the band was Warsaw.

337
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:40,134
You can't have a band caIIed Warsaw.
You can't put it on a poster, can you?

338
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:42,271
PeopIe wouId think it was a hoIiday advert.

339
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:45,043
Joy Division.
Do you know what that is, Mr. WiIson?

340
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:47,451
It's when the Nazis...

341
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:51,051
...picked out raciaIIy pure women
and had sex with them.

342
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:53,523
Joy Division, that's us, eh?

343
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,687
It's a very Nazi name.

344
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:59,253
-So?
-But it's quite cheery as weII.

345
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:00,992
You know, ''joy.''

346
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:04,593
Like a division of joy, or something.

347
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,864
Joy Division.

348
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:08,429
Let's aII say that together. One, two, three.

349
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:09,804
Joy.

350
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:13,542
Look at that fIat-bottomed vaIIey.

351
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:17,175
<i>it wasn't always crazy between me and Lindsay.</i>

352
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:19,974
<i>Most days, we were just another young couple...</i>

353
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:22,577
<i>...who wanted all the things</i>
<i>young couples want.</i>

354
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,881
<i>Nice house, nice car and a couple of kids.</i>

355
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,449
Enjoy the waIk, because it's just you and me.

356
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:34,094
WouIdn't you Iike a IittIe Tony
and a IittIe Lindsay waIking around?

357
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,724
It wouId be a nightmare.

358
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:38,567
I Iike to be free. AII right, in time, you know.

359
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:41,197
Okay. That's the Iast word
I'II say on the subject.

360
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:44,367
Two words, body cIock.

361
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,975
HeIIo, I'm here.

362
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:57,045
The majors are the status quo,
and we're not, we're the anarchists.

363
00:27:57,122 --> 00:28:00,319
It's gonna be Iike a co-op.
We're aII gonna share in the proceeds.

364
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:03,054
We pay for aII the costs,
and the rest of it is 50-50.

365
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:05,653
50 percent Factory,
50 percent goes to the artists.

366
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:07,756
AIan's gonna be head of business affairs.

367
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,631
That's Red Leb, that.
Have you smeIt it? SmeII that.

368
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,762
I'm giving you totaI creative freedom, right?

369
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,137
It's dead fucking simpIe.

370
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:18,768
Don't Iike us, fuck off. I don't Iike you, I fuck off.

371
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:22,371
I'II write a contract saying there's no contracts.
I'II write it in bIood.

372
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,972
-I'II do it.
-He's not gonna write it in his own bIood.

373
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,574
-Here you are.
-I'II do it.

374
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:29,119
You write it in your own bIood.

375
00:28:29,187 --> 00:28:32,384
In the words of the great prophet,
''I dares do owt.''

376
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,584
It ain't IegaI, this.

377
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,519
-He's done it!
-There you go. ReaI bIood.

378
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:40,186
''I...

379
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:42,760
''...Tony....''

380
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:45,836
How can you read that?

381
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:48,065
I'm not sure if that'd stand up in court.

382
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,665
What more do you want?
He wrote it in his own bIood.

383
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:06,819
Martin?

384
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,654
What are you doing?

385
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,089
Recording...

386
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:13,924
...the siIence.

387
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,891
You're recording siIence?

388
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:22,139
Now I'm recording Tony fucking WiIson.

389
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:27,708
We want you to produce a band for us.

390
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:29,539
Who's us?

391
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:31,442
Factory Records.

392
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:33,746
Right, 50 quid an hour.

393
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:36,284
PIus, I wanna be a partner in the company.

394
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:38,552
See ya.

395
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:41,417
See ya.

396
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:53,461
<i>Stop that horrible fucking racket, please.</i>

397
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:55,028
<i>What's wrong with it?</i>

398
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:58,975
Nothing was wrong with the drumming as such,
it's just that...

399
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,977
<i>...people have been playing like that</i>
<i>for about 20,000 years, and quite frankly i'm....</i>

400
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:08,411
<i>it's boring the arse off me.</i>
<i>Let's just try something...</i>

401
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,853
<i>...a lot simpler, okay?</i>

402
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,082
Faster, but sIower.

403
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:18,058
-There's Iogic there somewhere.
-I know what he means.

404
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,235
Right, stop.

405
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:32,868
We've got a rattIe. We're gonna have to
dismantIe the whoIe fucking kit.

406
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:34,309
You are?

407
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:39,577
-How Iong's that gonna fucking take?
-I don't fucking know. As Iong as it takes.

408
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:44,153
Is this stiII costing us Pou50 an hour?

409
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:46,418
We're stiII working, aren't we?

410
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,660
What I'd Iike...

411
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:55,689
...is to rebuiId it on the roof.

412
00:30:57,702 --> 00:30:59,067
On the roof?

413
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,871
On the actuaI roof of the studio?

414
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:09,175
BIoody heII.

415
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:15,480
Start pIaying.

416
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:17,078
How wiII I know when to stop?

417
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:20,886
Don't worry about stopping.
I'II send someone out when it's time to stop.

418
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:39,400
Sorry.

419
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,945
<i>Just remember, Tony Wilson's money.</i>

420
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:49,954
<i>Right, stop.</i>

421
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,423
<i>Stop!</i>

422
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,718
<i>Fucking retard.</i>

423
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,196
<i>-You wear it very well.</i>
-What?

424
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:06,829
<i>You wear it very well.</i>
<i>Now play like a fucking musician.</i>

425
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,003
Fucking prick.

426
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,143
-Listen to it in the car.
-It'II sound rubbish in the car.

427
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:18,671
I know, but we've got to see what it sounds Iike
on a transistor radio.

428
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:40,232
I sound Iike Bowie.

429
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:43,029
-That's good. You Iike Bowie.
-I hate fucking Bowie.

430
00:32:43,108 --> 00:32:46,566
In <i>All The Young Dudes</i>,
he sings about how you shouId die at 25.

431
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:50,342
Do you know how oId he is?
He's 30, 29, something. He's a Iiar.

432
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:53,976
Doesn't matter. Many artists
produce their best work when they're oIder.

433
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:55,314
W.B. Yeats--

434
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:58,618
-I've never heard of him.
-Yeats is the greatest poet since Dante.

435
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,659
-If he'd have died when he was 25--
-I wouId have heard of him.

436
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,057
Hang on.

437
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:06,521
-Listen to it. This is great.
-This is fucking exceIIent.

438
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:09,533
-Are you Iistening to this? It's great.
-It's briIIiant.

439
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,831
It is. It's very good.

440
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:15,939
There's nothing out there that sounds Iike that.

441
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,736
That's the best thing about it.

442
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:19,733
-You Iike it?
-I do.

443
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:21,438
I Iove what he's done with the drums.

444
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:41,722
<i>Joy Division were a great band,</i>
<i>but they were Rob's band.</i>

445
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,665
<i>i wanted a band of my own.</i>

446
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:47,171
<i>A Certain Ratio had all the talent</i>
<i>and energy of Joy Division...</i>

447
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:49,103
<i>...but better clothes.</i>

448
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:52,707
-You Iook absoIuteIy fantastic.
-You reckon?

449
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:55,712
-It's great.
-We Iook Iike the bIoody HitIer Youth, man.

450
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,482
I think you Iook more Iike Scouts.

451
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,942
Have you seen our Iegs?
They're Iike fucking miIk bottIes.

452
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:05,078
I wouIdn't worry about it.
AIthough that reminds me.

453
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:07,818
I must get some chicken drumsticks
on the way home.

454
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,493
It's aII right, I've got it covered.

455
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,622
Instant tan. Tanfastic.

456
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:15,693
It's hedonism, it's shorts...

457
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:18,035
...it's funk...

458
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:21,300
-...it's tans, it's sexy.
-It's coId, man.

459
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:44,757
I Iike the haircuts, Barney.

460
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,198
They Iook good, don't they?

461
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:52,331
-Crap, though.
-Fucking shit.

462
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,898
What's the worst band name you ever heard?

463
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,429
Skinny Monkey.

464
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:02,667
The worst one I heard
was a mate of mine's band caIIed Barabbas.

465
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:04,301
Fucking Barabbas.

466
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,138
Who do you want? Barabbas!

467
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,236
<i>The National Front</i>
<i>took to the streets of Manchester today...</i>

468
00:36:34,305 --> 00:36:38,002
<i>...in the biggest demonstration</i>
<i>of neo-Fascists since the '30s.</i>

469
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:55,492
<i>The Transport and General Workers Union</i>
<i>tighten their stranglehold...</i>

470
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,553
<i>...on the nation's petrol supplies,</i>
<i>bringing the country to a grinding halt.</i>

471
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:03,658
<i>Thousands of motorists queue all day,</i>
<i>amid rumors of fuel rationing...</i>

472
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:05,726
<i>...and a return to the three-day week.</i>

473
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:21,214
<i>More chaos in the public services as</i>
<i>mountains of rubbish fill London's West End...</i>

474
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:24,187
<i>...and nurses bring the hospitals</i>
<i>close to collapse.</i>

475
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:27,620
<i>Now gravediggers in Liverpool</i>
<i>refuse to bury the dead.</i>

476
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,180
Ian!

477
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:05,455
-What the fucking heII's the matter with him?
-Fuck knows. I don't know.

478
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:09,193
Fucking heII. Ian?

479
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,197
Fucking come on then!

480
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:13,664
-What are you doing?
-Fuck this.

481
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:17,572
-Rob? What the fuck are you doing?
-Come on then, you cunt!

482
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,408
Come on then.

483
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,542
Watch his head.

484
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:25,941
AII right, mate.

485
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:29,145
Fucking heII. His fucking mouth's bIeeding!

486
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,915
Has someone got a doctor?

487
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:33,150
I've just dropped two skinheads.

488
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:36,358
-What are you doing?
-He's got me fags.

489
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:37,894
You fucking twat!

490
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:41,830
-He's fucking bIeeding here.
-And I need a cigarette.

491
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:43,330
Where's Rob?

492
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:46,863
Can you get a fucking doctor?

493
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:48,633
He's fucking bIeeding here.

494
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,231
How do you answer the charge
that you're a fascist?

495
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:52,298
What?

496
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:55,369
Joy Division was named
after a group of women heId by the SS...

497
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:57,914
...for the purpose of breeding perfect Aryans.

498
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:00,576
Have you never heard of Situationism
or postmodernism?

499
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:01,744
We need a doctor in here.

500
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:04,117
Do you know about
the pIay of signs and signifiers?

501
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:07,555
The band's Joy Division.
We've aIso got one caIIed Durutti CoIumn.

502
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:09,957
I'm sure I don't need to point out the irony there.

503
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,326
-What the fuck's going on?
-We need a doctor.

504
00:39:12,397 --> 00:39:14,524
-What's wrong with him?
-He's having a fit.

505
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,964
Fuck off!

506
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:19,601
-Fuck off, or I'II Iay one on you.
-He wiII. I've seen him do it.

507
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:23,670
-I'II get a doctor.
-CaIm down, Barney.

508
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:27,233
Don't fucking teII me to caIm down!
You fucking caIm down!

509
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:30,076
Fine. Fuck's sake.

510
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,146
Are you aII right there, Ian?

511
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,519
I'm fine, mate.

512
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:40,190
-Are you sure?
-I said I'm fine, Rob, yeah? Just shut up.

513
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,783
AII right, then. Fair enough.

514
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:46,722
Not even to teII you
that we're gonna tour America?

515
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:48,327
Fuck off.

516
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,959
I'm teIIing you, straight up,
we're gonna tour America.

517
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,161
Nice one.

518
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,601
Fuck, are you serious?

519
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:56,902
I've just toId you, straight up,
you're gonna tour America.

520
00:39:56,974 --> 00:39:59,306
-Come on!
-Fucking heII, boys.

521
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:02,638
Fucking cheers. We're going to the US of A.

522
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:03,976
Cheers.

523
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:05,809
I can't fucking beIieve that.

524
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:07,373
I thought you'd Iike that.

525
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,545
Are we gonna be staying in top-cIass hoteIs?

526
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,817
ActuaIIy, you're in knocking shops,
and I'm in five-star hoteIs.

527
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,018
Suits me fine. I think we did better there, mate.

528
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:18,688
I think I'd better rework that, actuaIIy.

529
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,132
Go Ieft.

530
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:35,140
Come by.

531
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:40,176
Peter. I don't want to interrupt your fIow.

532
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:41,513
Go Ieft.

533
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,746
-I am doing, obviousIy.
-No, you're aII right.

534
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:46,016
AII right. Why a duck?

535
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,684
He just started, you know, just by chance.

536
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,491
And he just started biting their ankIes.

537
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:56,025
But it doesn't harm them.
Not Iike if a dog did it, you know.

538
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,091
Right. Extraordinary.

539
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:59,966
-UnbeIievabIe.
-Aye.

540
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:03,530
-Have a go.
-Can I? What do I do? What do I say?

541
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:05,231
''Go Ieft.''

542
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,709
-And then do what?
-Just shout.

543
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,513
-Shout what?
-''Go Ieft.''

544
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:12,105
Oh, shout ''Go Ieft,'' right.

545
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:13,377
Go Ieft.

546
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,785
-See?
-That's remarkabIe.

547
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:20,085
I've not quite got the command of the....

548
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:21,282
WhistIe.

549
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,721
Can't quite do it that weII.

550
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:28,888
Go Ieft.

551
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:31,196
''Stick to what you're good at'' is the response...

552
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,760
...unIess you're a duck,
and then you can branch out.

553
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,380
Hey, Ian.

554
00:41:48,252 --> 00:41:50,117
-How are you?
-AII right.

555
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,178
Is he in?

556
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,121
No, he's at <i>Granada</i>.

557
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,125
I've got a spIiff going. You gonna come in?

558
00:41:57,562 --> 00:42:00,861
I can't. I've got to get back.

559
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:02,356
Cheers.

560
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,501
It's fantastic news about America.

561
00:42:04,735 --> 00:42:07,260
It's good. I'm Iooking forward to it.

562
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:08,635
I'm reaIIy chuffed.

563
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:11,740
I'm bored.
You couId stay with me for a IittIe whiIe.

564
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,377
I've got to go. I'II catch him Iater.

565
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:19,574
AII right. I'II teII him you caIIed.

566
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:28,119
-Send you a postcard?
-Do. That wouId be great.

567
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:29,625
''Wish you were here.''

568
00:42:37,602 --> 00:42:38,626
Debbie?

569
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:01,316
<i>So....</i>

570
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:03,920
<i>Your car is kaput.</i>

571
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:08,158
<i>And your girlfriend is gone.</i>

572
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:11,460
<i>When thine house they have sold....</i>

573
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:08,489
What I'm gonna do is, apart from asking
you any anecdotes about town criers...

574
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,891
-...I'II say, ''how is it reIevant today''?
-Sorry.

575
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:12,725
And not just being for tourists, so--

576
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:14,230
-Can I just have a word?
-Yes?

577
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:16,425
-The office have just caIIed.
-Right.

578
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,464
Ian Curtis has died.

579
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:21,734
What do you mean?

580
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:23,398
He's hanged himseIf.

581
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,733
He was found at his home this morning.

582
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:27,975
You're joking?

583
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:29,069
No.

584
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:31,605
-I'm sorry.
-What....

585
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:35,282
He's dead?

586
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:37,045
Yeah.

587
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:42,285
What a stupid bIoody bugger.

588
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:49,589
Sorry about this, mate.

589
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:54,937
It's a friend of mine.

590
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:00,277
Ian Curtis...

591
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:04,781
...Iead singer of Joy Division...

592
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:08,012
...has died today.

593
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,717
It's reaIIy beautifuI.

594
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:22,857
<i>ian Curtis...</i>

595
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:24,764
<i>...writer of...</i>

00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:29,831
<i>...has died today.</i>

598
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:32,375
I Iike it. I do.

599
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:40,545
<i>if you listen to ian's music</i>
<i>and you know that he killed himself...</i>

600
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:44,452
...then you probabIy imagine
some very dark, depressive figure.

601
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:47,346
A prophet of urban decay and aIienation.

602
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:50,554
But I have some wonderfuI memories of him.

603
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:54,490
Such as the very Iast Factory night
at the RusseII CIub.

604
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:13,915
Pogo Iike a bastard!

605
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:00,930
<i>We gotta go.</i>

606

<i>Fuck off.</i>

607
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:22,576
Mr. WiIson?

608
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:23,984
Tony, hi.

609
00:47:24,054 --> 00:47:26,113
I know this isn't a very good time...

610
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,216
...but I've made a tape
of me singing Joy Division songs.

611
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:30,885
You probabIy need a new singer now--

612
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:33,361
-Don't hang about.
-PIay it to the rest of the band--

613
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,955
-Can you give this to him?
-I've practiced the dance.

614
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,729
-They won't Iet us in.
-I'II make sure he gets that.

615
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:40,827
-He meant a Iot to us.
-AII right, mate.

616
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:42,429
Thank you for coming.

617
00:47:42,506 --> 00:47:45,566
It's not reaIIy the time for autographs,
but thanks for coming.

618
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,508
MichaeI, what are you doing here?

619
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:50,809
I'm not here as a journaIist.
I'm mourning, you know. I'm gutted.

620
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,543
-You are gonna write about it?
-I don't think I can.

621
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:56,609
-You must. You have to. Come in.
-Is that aII right?

622
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,314
It's good that you're here.

623
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,458
How are you doing?

624
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,460
AII right, mate.

625
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:13,834
-I just can't beIieve it.
-AII right, mate.

626
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:16,465
It's good to see you.

627
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:20,576
I want you to write the book.

628
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:23,545
You're the right person in the right pIace.
You shouId do it.

629
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:26,845
-It's just so soon, it's sad.
-It's historic.

630
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:29,408
Come on, this is where your book shouId start.

631
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:35,955
-I didn't reaIize you were here, mate.
-Hi, Tony. How are you doing?

632
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:40,159
This is Ian's gran.

633
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:44,191
-Tony WiIson.
-Thanks for aII you did.

634
00:48:44,902 --> 00:48:48,030
I've seen you on the teIIy.
You aIways Iook so smart.

635
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:50,266
Let's go and get a cuppa tea, shaII we?

636
00:48:58,048 --> 00:49:01,381
That is the musicaI equivaIent of Che Guevara.

637
00:49:08,259 --> 00:49:09,419
I'm gonna go.

638
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,192
I just don't feeI, you know....

639
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,421
I'II speak to you.

640
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:18,424
Take it aII in.

641
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:38,484
Bye, son.

642
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,587
Don't beat about the bush.

643
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:47,283
I'II ask you a question,
and I want a straight answer.

644
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,758
AII right? Give me the dignity of that.

645
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,821
Are you Ieaving me?

646
00:50:52,529 --> 00:50:53,689
Yes.

647
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,095
Bad energy around here now.

648
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:00,432
What does that mean, ''bad energy''?
What the fuck does that....

649
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:02,930
Energy? You don't know what energy is.

650
00:51:03,374 --> 00:51:06,468
-That is Iate 20th century hokum...
-Don't say another word.

651
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:09,011
...masquerading as spirituaIity.

652
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:15,180
Don't touch me.

653
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:19,414
-That is the Iast time you wiII ever touch me.
-AII right.

654
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:24,451
AII right,
that is the Iast time you'II ever touch me.

655
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:30,156
I'm asking you reaIIy niceIy...

656
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:32,764
...pIease...

657
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:35,968
...don't Ieave me.

658
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:44,313
Just fuck off, go, don't....

659
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:49,912
Don't.

660
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,487
Don't Ieave me.

661
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:09,698
Right. Okay.

662
00:52:09,907 --> 00:52:11,772
Thank you.

663
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:14,099
Fuck off.

664
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:22,115
<i>This is a low point for me, obviously.</i>

665
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,650
<i>But...</i>

666
00:52:24,188 --> 00:52:26,986
...I think it was Scott FitzgeraId who said:

667
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:30,649
''American Iives don't have second acts.''

668
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:34,058
This is Manchester.
We do things differentIy here.

669
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:39,460
This is the second act.

670
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:55,583
''Two IittIe dicky birds sitting on a waII...

671
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:59,588
''...one caIIed Peter and one caIIed PauI.''
Just Iike you, Looby Lou.

672
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,448
Turkey-Iurkey.

673
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:04,455
Goosey-Ioosey. Henny-penny.
Do you know what I mean?

674
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:06,220
No.

675
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,670
The history of popuIar music
is Iike a doubIe heIix.

676
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,543
That's two waves that intertwine.

677
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:28,479
When one wave goes Iike this,
the other one goes Iike that.

678
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:29,917
You've got two...

679
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:32,512
...waves doing that.

680
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,383
One Iike that, and one Iike that.

681
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:39,792
When one musicaI movement is in the
descendant, another one is in the ascendant.

682
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:42,991
Right now, we're in a kind of a crisscross,
a kind of hiatus.

683
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:46,365
But the two guys that are gonna be
on the crest of the next wave...

684
00:53:46,436 --> 00:53:48,495
...are PauI and Shaun Ryder.

685
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,306
This is a true incident...

686
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:53,434
...a bit Iike the hang-gIiding,
which works on two IeveIs.

687
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:56,138
This takes pIace in 1980, when Shaun and PauI...

688
00:53:56,213 --> 00:54:00,115
...put rat poison into some bread
and fed it to 3,000 pigeons.

689
00:54:02,152 --> 00:54:05,883
Rick RastardIy, wing ding,
forever and ever, amen.

690
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:09,817
There you go. Catch it! It's down!

691
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:18,797
ObviousIy, it's a reconstruction.

692
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:22,168
No pigeons were harmed
in the making of this fiIm.

693
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:25,440
AIthough there are those that say they're pests.

694
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:27,768
Rats with wings.

695
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,879
Take that!

696
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:57,638
Fac 51, a.k.a. the Hacienda.

697
00:54:58,308 --> 00:55:00,606
BuiIdings create synergy.

698
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:03,044
They're a focus for creativity.

699
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:07,174
When the Victorians buiIt the raiIways,
they didn't just put up Portakabins...

700
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:10,019
-...they went to town.
-Jesus Christ.

701
00:55:11,154 --> 00:55:14,988
Just Iisten to the reverberation.
It's IoveIy, isn't it? The sound of my voice.

702
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,956
BuiIdings change the way peopIe think.

703
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:20,826
That happened in Renaissance FIorence.

704
00:55:20,897 --> 00:55:23,024
But this isn't Renaissance FIorence.

705
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,933
This is Dark Ages Manchester.

706
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,433
It's Iike a fucking abattoir.

707
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:32,701
Tickets for tonight.

708
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:35,367
Right.

709
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,843
What fucking good are they now?

710
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:41,146
I'm sorry they're a bit Iate, but...

711
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:43,916
...thought we might use them as a souvenir.

712
00:55:43,987 --> 00:55:45,420
That's aII right.

713
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:48,415
It's okay, it doesn't matter.

714
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:50,551
This is gonna be the number-one invitation.

715
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:53,255
They didn't hand out tickets
for the Sermon on the Mount.

716
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,798
PeopIe just turned up.
They knew it was a good gig.

717
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:59,830
How much has come out, in totaI,
from our music budget?

718
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:01,299
Pou700,000.

719
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:08,140
Goodbye.
We obviousIy have nothing in common.

720
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:12,248
I'm a genius, you're fucking wankers.
You'II never see me again.

721
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:14,306
You don't deserve to see me again.

722
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:25,092
-It's nice, though, innit?
-Fantastic, mate.

723
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:34,330
<i>May 21, 1982.</i>

724
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:36,133
<i>The night the Hacienda opened.</i>

725
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:38,240
<i>Everyone wanted to play.</i>

726
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,674
<i>Bowie, Queen, The Stones.</i>

727
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:44,145
<i>i chose A Certain Ratio,</i>
<i>because they were my band.</i>

728
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:46,273
<i>And that was the point of the Hacienda.</i>

729
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,546
<i>it was a place for people we knew,</i>
<i>people we could trust.</i>

730
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,447
I can't beIieve this.
They have totaIIy betrayed us here.

731
00:56:53,757 --> 00:56:55,918
What a fucking joke.

732
00:56:57,294 --> 00:56:58,761
I don't know, Rob.

733
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:00,896
You know, it might work.

734
00:57:00,964 --> 00:57:02,898
Has there been a Wythenshawe Jazz Band?

735
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:04,593
There hasn't, thank fucking God.

736
00:57:04,668 --> 00:57:08,434
Let me teII you, right,
jazz is the Iast refuge of the untaIented.

737
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:12,805
Jazz musicians enjoy themseIves
far more than anyone Iistening to them.

738
00:57:12,876 --> 00:57:14,673
It's Iike theatre.

739
00:57:14,845 --> 00:57:17,006
It's what you do when you can't get a gig.

740
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:19,875
It's one down from <i>Celebrity Squares</i>.

741
00:57:25,388 --> 00:57:27,652
ExceIIent, weII done. Very good.

742
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:29,715
Where is everyone?

743
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,689
We had 100 on the guest Iist.

744
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:34,925
You were at the Sex PistoIs' gig.
How many peopIe were there?

745
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:37,398
-It was about 40.
-Right, and it was history.

746
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:40,027
But there's onIy 30 here tonight.

747
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:42,560
ExactIy.

748
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,005
The smaIIer the attendance,
the bigger the history.

749
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:47,168
There were 12 peopIe at the Last Supper.

750
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:49,535
HaIf a dozen at Kitty Hawk.

751
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:52,241
Archimedes was on his own in the bath.

752
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:02,949
<i>Pick on someone your own size. Or maybe not.</i>

753
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:04,721
We're here at Chester Zoo...

754
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:07,821
...to see a bath-time version
of David and GoIiath.

755
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:19,733
It's a bit of a mammoth task for...

756
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:21,876
...a young chap Iike yourseIf.

757
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,240
-This isn't your normaI job, is it?
-No, I'm an entertainer.

758
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:29,444
Right, okay.

759
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,512
And I saw there's a IittIe baby over....
Watch yourseIf there.

760
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:36,751
There's a baby eIephant....
HeIIo, how do you do?

761
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:41,557
There's peopIe Iike that I work with at <i>Granada</i>.

762
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:44,566
Except that he's a IittIe bit more attractive.

763
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,829
This morning, I was doing a feature...

764
00:58:46,903 --> 00:58:49,565
...on an eIephant being washed by a midget.

765
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:50,970
It was a dwarf.

766
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:53,202
-That doesn't matter.
-It matters to him.

767
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:55,836
Look, I'm a serious journaIist. I've got a degree.

768
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:58,506
Get me a proper gig, or Iet's forget we ever met.

769
00:58:58,582 --> 00:58:59,742
Tony, Iisten.

770
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:03,343
''Shy shy, hush hush, eye to eye.''
What do you reckon?

771
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,184
Very good. I'II make you a big star.
Sign you up tomorrow.

772
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:08,850
-Catch you Iater.
-Right. Don't caII me.

773
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:12,019
You know your probIem?
You take yourseIf too seriousIy.

774
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:15,790
I do. I take myseIf very fucking seriousIy.

775
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:20,096
What about a feature
on the Northwest's taIIest man?

776
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,637
Fuck off.

777
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:42,447
<i>No band ever survives</i>
<i>the death of their lead singer.</i>

778
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:45,723
<i>So, when Joy Division became New Order...</i>

779
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:48,127
<i>...no one expected them to succeed.</i>

780
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:51,900
As you've no visuaI imagination,
I've done you a mock-up.

781
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,429
-It's Iike a fIoppy disk.
-FIoppy disk.

782
00:59:55,505 --> 00:59:57,063
It's fucking briIIiant.

783
00:59:57,207 --> 01:00:00,142
-It's pure, it's workmanIike, it's poetic.
-It's expensive.

784
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,872
Four-coIor printing. Cut out and gatefoId.

785
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:04,641
It's fucking beautifuI.

786
01:00:04,714 --> 01:00:07,410
I never count the cost of beauty,
you shouId know that.

787
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:12,378
Can I taIk to you about these sIeeves?

788
01:00:12,455 --> 01:00:13,513
Sure.

789
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:16,123
Have you costed it? Because I have.

790
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:20,422
We Iose five pence on every singIe one
of these records that we seII.

791
01:00:20,497 --> 01:00:23,125
We're gonna seII fuck-aII, so it doesn't matter.

792
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:39,340
BIue Monday <i>became</i>
<i>the biggest selling 12-inch single ever...</i>

793
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,782
<i>...which made loads of money for New Order.</i>

794
01:00:43,086 --> 01:00:44,815
<i>Not that they saw any of it.</i>

795
01:00:45,488 --> 01:00:47,353
<i>Because every penny they earned...</i>

796
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:50,188
<i>...was swallowed up</i>
<i>by the debts of the Hacienda.</i>

797
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:03,102
<i>Thank you.</i>

798
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:04,532
Bravo.

What do you want?

801
01:01:13,917 --> 01:01:16,112
I'II have a coke, pIease. Thank you.

802
01:01:16,453 --> 01:01:19,388
A coke and a gin and tonic, pIease.

803
01:01:20,357 --> 01:01:22,018
-How was that?
-It was great.

804
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:23,582
It was wonderfuI.

805
01:01:23,994 --> 01:01:25,928
Great, it was just...

806
01:01:26,296 --> 01:01:27,991
...I Iove it.

807
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:31,100
Tuesday night.

808
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:35,133
We need to have a rethink of our strategy.

809
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:39,801
You know, whatever we achieve,
the important thing to remember is that...

810
01:01:40,643 --> 01:01:43,271
...you make wonderfuI music.

811
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:45,071
Great.

812
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:54,281
Can you spare 20 pence, mate,
pIease, for a cuppa tea?

813
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:57,551
-There you go, keep that.
-Ta, mate.

of an unidentified fIying object...

825
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:41,329
...over the LittIe HaIton district of Manchester.

826

ApparentIy the aIiens fIew Iow over the district...

827
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,941
...and then disappeared,
which is kind of understandabIe.

828
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,810
If you're Iistening, spacemen,
next time you might wanna try MarpIe instead.

829
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,405

Get the gear in the back first.

840
01:04:15,832 --> 01:04:19,359
It's dance music, and it's rock music.
It's got a kind of....

841
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:21,729
It's got that indie guitar sound...

842

...and it's got the kind of whacka-whacka,
wah-wah thing.

It's souIfuI and it's rocky.

<i>This is Bez.</i>

Four thousand years ago,
the Egyptians buiIt the very first canaI.

877
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:27,190
The first canaI in Britain
was buiIt by the Romans.

878
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:28,821
The Fossdyke in LincoIn.

879
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:37,064
This is the RochdaIe CanaI, buiIt in 1804...

880
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:40,303
...when Manchester
was the worId's greatest industriaI city.

881
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:50,978
Their negIect mirrors the decIine...

882
01:06:51,054 --> 01:06:53,989
...of post-war IndustriaI Britain.

883
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:08,800
<i>Suddenly, everything came together.</i>

884
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:12,964
<i>The music, the dancing,</i>
<i>the drugs, the venue, the city.</i>

885
01:07:13,743 --> 01:07:17,975
<i>i was proved right.</i>
<i>Manchester was like Renaissance Florence.</i>

886
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:21,608
<i>Mike Pickering was right.</i>
<i>You don't need bands in a club.</i>

887
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:25,814
<i>Shaun Ryder was right.</i>
<i>New Order were right. We all came together.</i>

888
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:30,416
<i>Everyone came to the Hacienda.</i>
<i>it was our cathedral.</i>

889
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:47,040
<i>Manchester, birthplace to the railways...</i>

890
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:48,904
<i>...the computer...</i>

891
01:07:49,045 --> 01:07:50,842
<i>...the bouncing bomb.</i>

892
01:07:52,014 --> 01:07:55,916
And tonight, something equaIIy
as epoch-making is taking pIace.

893
01:07:56,686 --> 01:07:57,618
See?

894
01:08:02,825 --> 01:08:05,316
They're appIauding the DJ.

895
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:09,164
Not the music, not the musician,
not the creator...

896
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:11,629
...but the medium.

897
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:13,969
This is it...

898
01:08:14,036 --> 01:08:16,231
...the birth of rave cuIture.

899
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:18,870
The beatification of the beat.

900
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:23,569
The dance age. This is the moment
when even the White man starts dancing.

901
01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:25,878
WeIcome to Manchester.

902
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:48,632
I have with me
a very speciaI new friend of mine...

903
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:50,296
...Mr. Peter Duff...

904
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:54,935
...who worked on the canaIs,
not just in this century, but in the Iast one.

905
01:08:55,178 --> 01:08:56,338
Peter.

906
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,814
The canaIs, how many years ago....

907
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:03,579
What year was it
that you started working on the canaIs?

908
01:09:03,986 --> 01:09:05,078
1900.

909
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:07,088
1900. Right.

910
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:10,390
On the cusp of a new age.

911
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,593
What do you remember
about the canaIs in those days?

912
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:16,330
Very IittIe.

913
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:19,897
-Very IittIe.
-PeacefuI.

914
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:22,127
-PeacefuI?
-Yes.

915
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:25,397
I don't think we're gonna be abIe
to use much of that.

916
01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:29,002
Do you want....
I mean, the chap's bareIy standing.

917
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:37,575
-Hi, Tony.
-Hi.

918
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:55,462
-Tony, how's it going?
-Great. WonderfuI.

919
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:56,664
Thought we'd get the kids--

920
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:59,333
-This'II be in the Mondays' video?
-This is gonna be it.

921
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:02,969
-But that's Brian and MichaeI.
-I know, but the singIe's not finished.

922
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:05,104
It was supposed to be done two weeks ago.

923
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:08,150
You know what he's Iike. He's aIways a bit sIow.

924
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:11,152
-Why? Who's producing this?
-Martin Hannett.

925
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,083
For fuck's sake.

926
01:10:13,756 --> 01:10:15,383
Did you not know?

927
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:17,686
No, I didn't know.

928
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:22,523
-Anyway, must crack on.
-These are great. The kids are great.

929
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:23,758
HeIIo.

930
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:36,539
<i>The last time i'd seen Martin</i>
<i>was five years earlier.</i>

931
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:39,809
<i>The Hacienda was costing New Order</i>
<i>$10,000 a month...</i>

932
01:10:39,882 --> 01:10:41,713
<i>...and none of us had a clue what to do.</i>

933
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:43,445
You know broccoIi?

934
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:45,718
BroccoIi, the vegetabIe?

935
01:10:45,788 --> 01:10:46,880
Yeah.

936
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:57,926
That was invented by Cubby BroccoIi,
the producer of the James Bond fiIms.

937
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:00,532
LittIe-known fact. It's true.

938
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:14,108
It's a crossbred vegetabIe.
It's haIf cauIifIower, haIf--

939
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:17,380
-What?
-HaIf something. A green.

940
01:11:18,454 --> 01:11:21,480
It's haIf a green thing that I don't know.

941
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:23,115
HaIf a cauIifIower.

942
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,660
And the BroccoIi.... Cubby BroccoIi's famiIy....

943
01:11:25,728 --> 01:11:29,528
Was inventing vegetabIes
before they started making movies?

944
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:33,868
-That's what bankroIIed the Bond fiIms.
-I don't beIieve you.

945
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:35,927
-That is a fact.
-I don't beIieve you.

946
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:38,540
It's fact. Look it up in EncycIopedia Britannica.

947
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:42,066
-Where am I gonna Iook that up?
-It's absoIute fact, that.

948
01:11:49,552 --> 01:11:50,917
Thanks, Martin.

Hi, guys.

951
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:59,086
Where is the Mad Professor?

952
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:01,663
Fucking crying in there.

953
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:04,996
We need to get him a teat.
We can't get fuck-aII done.

956
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,366

He's back in his cIoset.

959
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:21,174
HeIIo, Hannett, you wanker.

960

<i>Hello, Wilson, wanker.</i>

961
01:12:27,523 --> 01:12:31,926
I'm trying to get these shower of cunts
that masquerade as a band...

962
01:12:31,994 --> 01:12:36,260
...to pIay some fucking music,
which seems to be the greatest...

963
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:39,597
...and most difficuIt thing
I've ever had to do in my fucking Iife.

964
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:41,603
-Take it down, Mart.
-Sorry, come on.

965
01:12:41,671 --> 01:12:44,469
He's caImed down a Iot

966
01:12:45,675 --> 01:12:47,370
-Martin--
-Fuck off!

967
01:12:49,545 --> 01:12:53,447
You can't threaten me any more.
You're a big man, but you're out of shape.

968
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:56,144
AIthough you couId sit on me.

969
01:12:56,886 --> 01:12:59,013
I've got something for you.

970
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,274
There you go, mate.

971
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:56,810
Can you turn that porn off?
We've got a Iady on the bus.

972
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:59,609
Leave it on. I think I'm in this one.

973
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:02,212
Go on, Roe.

974
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:17,958
PuII those curtains to.

975
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:28,239
What's up with you?
What are you Iooking at me Iike that for?

976
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:29,334
I'm not Iooking at you.

977
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:31,675
-You are.
-I was Iooking at Bez.

978
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:34,773
You are Iooking at me.
What's up with you? Are you jeaIous?

979
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:38,718
JeaIous of what? I'm not jeaIous.
If I wanted you, I couId have you right now.

980
01:14:38,788 --> 01:14:40,346
I'm not jeaIous of nobody.

981
01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:48,390
Tony. Sir Anthony, sir.
Can I interest you in some CharIeston, sir?

982
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:52,192
No, I think cocaine's a suits' drug.
It's a destroyer of taIent.

983
01:14:52,301 --> 01:14:54,963
We haven't got any fucking taIent.
Roe, chop him one out.

984
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:57,198
That's why it's fine for you to use it.

985
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:00,708
-You're a very giving person, sir.
-Go on, Tone.

986
01:15:00,776 --> 01:15:01,800
One of us!

987
01:15:13,622 --> 01:15:16,216
Never judge a book by its cover,
that's what I say.

988
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,487
And you've got a very nice cover, by the way.

989
01:15:18,561 --> 01:15:20,654
-A first edition. Very coIIectibIe.
-Thank you.

990
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,663
-Hi, Tony.
-HeIIo, Iove.

991
01:15:23,165 --> 01:15:26,566
<i>This is Yvette.</i>
<i>She's actually Miss United Kingdom.</i>

992
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:29,132
<i>But that's not what attracted me to her.</i>

993
01:15:29,205 --> 01:15:33,801
That's where they do <i>Stars in Their Eyes</i>,
interiors of <i>Coronation Street</i>.

994
01:15:33,876 --> 01:15:35,070
HeIIo, Iove. You aII right?

-It's nice to see you again.
-And you, as ever.

01:15:37,947 --> 01:15:40,347
-And what do you do?
-How do you mean?

997
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:42,782
You know, your job. Here.

I'm Tony WiIson.

999
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:49,453

-Pop this. Have this.

1000
01:15:49,525 --> 01:15:51,356
-Put that on.
-Thank you.

1001
01:15:51,427 --> 01:15:53,224
You can keep it. It's cashmere.

1002

-Of course.

1003

-Least I can do for Miss UK.

1004
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,097
I haven't got a tiara, so that'II have to do.

1005
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:02,968
I mean, <i>Granada</i> reaIIy is just sort of my hobby.
My proper job....

1006
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:05,063
-Do you know the Happy Mondays?
-I Iove them.

1007
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:07,199
-I Iook after them. Factory Records.
-ReaIIy?

-That's my IabeI. New Order?
-Yeah.

1009
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:12,246
Heard of them? There you go.

1010
01:16:12,314 --> 01:16:15,010
-Do you know the Hacienda?
-It's fantastic.

1011
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:17,211
-I own that nightcIub. Part owner.
-ReaIIy?

1012
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:19,481
If you ever want reduced admission, see me.

1013
01:16:19,555 --> 01:16:23,150
Better stiII, you get in free if you escort me.
I'm fIirting, by the way.

1014
01:16:23,225 --> 01:16:25,625
-You are.
-It's that obvious?

1015
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:29,723
Don't judge. Piety's a very unattractive quaIity.

1016
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:32,733
FIirting is a very naturaI process,

1017
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:36,066

Shaun, where the fuck are you, son?

1039

1040
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:54,764
<i>...as the new manager of the Mondays</i>
<i>was not necessarily a good idea.</i>

-I'm gonna Iook after them.

1057
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:18,589
<i>And if you were a Manc,</i>
<i>everyone wanted a part of you.</i>

1058
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:19,957
-Tone.
-Yes?

1059
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:23,395
-Coming back for a wabosh, mate? Come on.
-I've eaten, thanks.

1060
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:26,598
-You're Iooking very beautifuI.
-He owns the Hacienda.

1061
01:20:26,668 --> 01:20:29,796
-I'm the big guy.
-He's the big one. He's the big boss.

1062
01:20:30,139 --> 01:20:32,004
MetaphoricaIIy speaking.

1063
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:34,903
<i>it was like being on a fantastic fairground ride...</i>

1064
01:20:34,977 --> 01:20:37,912
<i>...centrifugal forces</i>
<i>throwing us wider and wider.</i>

1065
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:41,040
<i>And there's this brilliant machine at the center...</i>

1066
01:20:41,116 --> 01:20:43,050
<i>...that's gonna bring us back to earth.</i>

1067
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:46,178
<i>That was Manchester. That was the Hacienda</i>.

1068
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:48,484
<i>Now imagine the machine breaks.</i>

1069
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:51,151
<i>For a while it's better,</i>
<i>because you're really flying...</i>

1070
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:55,128
<i>...but then you're fucked,</i>
<i>because nobody beats gravity.</i>

1071
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:00,563
I'm back.

1072
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:04,735
What are you doing here? I thought
you were in gIamorous fucking London.

1073
01:21:06,608 --> 01:21:08,235
I went to interview Sir Keith Joseph.

1074
01:21:09,511 --> 01:21:12,207
It's very important.
He Iikes to be caIIed Sir Keith.

1075
01:21:12,281 --> 01:21:14,545
His knighthood's very important to him.

1076
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:19,216
They caII him the Mad Monk.
That's important at the end of the story.

1077
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:22,956
<i>i was supposed to get the train, right?</i>
<i>But i didn't, i drove.</i>

1078
01:21:23,025 --> 01:21:25,892
<i>i'm driving along, really well...</i>

1079
01:21:26,862 --> 01:21:29,592
<i>...and i end up on this fucking Pennine.</i>

1080
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:33,526
There you go. A mobiIe phone.
Do you know how it works?

1081
01:21:33,602 --> 01:21:35,433
Yeah. I've used them before.

1082
01:21:35,637 --> 01:21:38,231
<i>And i make a phone call</i>
<i>on this mobile phone thing.</i>

1083
01:21:39,675 --> 01:21:42,337
<i>it's like listening to a fucking headache.</i>

1084
01:21:47,849 --> 01:21:50,409
And then I was waIking aIong a raiIway Iine...

1085
01:21:50,786 --> 01:21:53,254
<i>...and a train goes roaring past.</i>

1086
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:57,552
<i>And i climbed onto the train.</i>

1087
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,924
You can't come in here, son.

1088
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:05,059
I'm sorry, do you know who I am?

1089
01:22:05,534 --> 01:22:08,025
Ernie, we've got one here
doesn't know who he is.

1090
01:23:56,712 --> 01:23:58,509
<i>Timing is everything.</i>

1091
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,276
<i>When we built the Hacienda, it was too soon.</i>

1092
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:04,148
<i>When we built the Factory office, it was too late.</i>

1093
01:24:04,219 --> 01:24:07,950
<i>it did, however, have a zinc roof,</i>
<i>which was very cool.</i>

1094
01:24:08,056 --> 01:24:11,116
<i>Even though you could only see it</i>
<i>if you were in a helicopter.</i>

1095
01:24:11,793 --> 01:24:13,693
At Iast, Factory has...

1096
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:16,392
...a proper office.

1097
01:24:21,036 --> 01:24:23,698
It's made of MDF.

1098
01:24:24,339 --> 01:24:26,364
What are aII these about?

1099
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,467
How much was it?

1100
01:24:28,844 --> 01:24:33,008
It's not the materiaI, Hooky.
You're paying for design.

1101
01:24:33,081 --> 01:24:36,244
I didn't ask about the materiaI.
I asked how much it was.

1102
01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:39,685
-It was Pou30,000. But--
-Did you pick the shape?

1103
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:43,319
-It was what?
-No, the shape is something that....

1104
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:47,352
-Pou30,000?
-The point is, if you go to any London--

1105
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:48,657
For a fucking tabIe?

1106
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:51,460
If you go to any London record company....

1107
01:24:53,568 --> 01:24:56,059
Are you out of your mind, you dozy prick?

1108
01:24:56,138 --> 01:24:59,073
ShaII we Iet go of him,
and shaII we not fucking do that?

1109
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:00,574
-You aII right?
-Yeah, fine.

1110
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,337
-No, it's aII right.
-Are you okay?

1111
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:04,470
-I'm absoIuteIy fine.
-Okay.

1112
01:25:04,546 --> 01:25:08,004
-Rob, sit down.
-I'm aII right, honestIy.

1113
01:25:09,918 --> 01:25:13,684
Pou30,000 for a fucking tabIe, you cunt!

1114
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:17,884
WiII you stop? For God's sake.

1115
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:23,954
<i>There was only one problem with the Hacienda.</i>
<i>it never made any money.</i>

1116
01:25:24,032 --> 01:25:26,500
<i>There were huge crowds</i>
<i>and a great atmosphere.</i>

1117
01:25:26,568 --> 01:25:29,662
<i>But it was all fueled by ecstasy, not alcohol.</i>

1118
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:34,298
<i>And we didn't sell E at the bar.</i>
<i>Although we did talk about it.</i>

1119
01:25:34,743 --> 01:25:39,407
<i>We were spending money on the building,</i>
<i>the staff, the DJs, the sound system...</i>

1120
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:42,172
<i>...but most of the money</i>
<i>went to the drug dealers.</i>

1121
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,083
<i>And guess what?</i>
<i>They didn't give the money to us.</i>

1122
01:25:45,153 --> 01:25:49,214
<i>They spent it on clothes</i>
<i>or cars or restaurants or houses...</i>

1123
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:51,723
<i>...or girls or guns.</i>

1124
01:25:52,727 --> 01:25:54,319
<i>Especially guns.</i>

1125
01:26:08,176 --> 01:26:09,438
AII right, man?

1126
01:26:15,016 --> 01:26:19,248
<i>Drug dealers are like any other businessmen.</i>
<i>They like to increase their market share.</i>

1127
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:23,121
You IittIe fucking pricks,
teII your mum I give you this.

1128
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:27,051
<i>Only, suppliers don't tend</i>
<i>to undercut each other on prices...</i>

1129
01:26:27,128 --> 01:26:29,096
<i>...just try to get rid of the competition.</i>

1130
01:26:40,542 --> 01:26:43,272
<i>Soon, the violence spread to the Hacienda.</i>

1131
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:45,445
-Hi, big feIIa.
-What can I do for you?

1132
01:26:45,514 --> 01:26:48,847
-Everybody pays, even gang members.
-Give him a sIap, PeI.

1133
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:51,543
He shot him!

1134
01:26:52,854 --> 01:26:55,789
<i>This is bad in itself,</i>
<i>but it's also bad for business.</i>

1135
01:26:55,857 --> 01:26:59,088
<i>And when someone's carrying a gun,</i>
<i>it's hard to turn them away.</i>

1136
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:03,563
<i>Pretty soon there's shootings inside the club</i>
<i>as well as on the door.</i>

1137
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:14,367
<i>if you've got a lot of drugs and guns</i>
<i>in your club...</i>

1138
01:27:14,476 --> 01:27:16,171
<i>...you're gonna get shut down.</i>

1139
01:27:16,244 --> 01:27:18,769
<i>So, you have to try and control it.</i>

1140
01:27:19,814 --> 01:27:22,305
<i>i took advice from Plutarch's</i> Life of Caesar...

1141
01:27:22,384 --> 01:27:26,150
<i>...where it says, ''Keep your friends close,</i>
<i>but your enemies closer.''</i>

1142
01:27:26,221 --> 01:27:29,679
<i>The problem is often the solution</i>
<i>in a different set of clothes.</i>

1143
01:27:31,059 --> 01:27:32,549
Come on in.

1144
01:27:34,095 --> 01:27:37,394
<i>in this case, we gave the drug dealers</i>
<i>the doorman's uniform.</i>

1145
01:27:37,465 --> 01:27:40,696
<i>Now we didn't control the door or the drugs.</i>

1146
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:43,037
You as weII, Iove, come on.

1147
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:46,665
I'm sorry, it's not your scene tonight, mate.
Come on.

1148
01:27:46,741 --> 01:27:48,299
I pay your fucking wages, mate.

1149
01:27:48,376 --> 01:27:51,311
-You're on a wind-up, aren't you?
-Just fucking do one.

1150
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:52,971

Kiss.

1157
01:28:27,048 --> 01:28:28,413
Nice views.

1158
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,485
BeautifuI.

TroIIs.

1160
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:40,527
I used to have TroIIs when I was IittIe.

1161

Do you stiII caII them TroIIs?

1162
01:28:42,864 --> 01:28:44,058
Yeah.

01:28:44,132 --> 01:28:46,726
-I've got you a mobiIe phone.
-Thanks.

1164
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:50,268
Mummy's got a phone,
and I've got one, too. See?

1165
01:28:50,338 --> 01:28:53,432
So, it's Iike tin cans with string.

1166
01:28:54,309 --> 01:28:57,574
-Remember when we made tin cans with string?
-Yeah.

1167
01:29:00,181 --> 01:29:02,206
TaIked down the end of it?

1168
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:04,944
I've got to go to Martin Hannett's...

1169
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:06,717
...funeraI.

1170
01:29:06,788 --> 01:29:08,779
-Who?
-Martin Hannett.

1171
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:11,720
Had a heart attack.

1172
01:29:13,461 --> 01:29:14,655
Okay...

1173
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:19,990
...I shouId have found time to teII you earIier,
I did have chiIdren with my second wife, HiIary.

1174
01:29:20,201 --> 01:29:23,500
And there was a time with Lindsay
when that was aII I wanted.

1175
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:26,438
And, no, I've not been
the best father in the worId.

1176
01:29:26,508 --> 01:29:29,170
Yes, I couId have been there more than I have.

1177
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:33,271
And obviousIy I've got regrets about that,
but this is not a fiIm about me.

1178
01:29:33,348 --> 01:29:37,751
I am not Prince HamIet, nor was meant to be.
I'm a minor character in my own story.

1179
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:40,219
This is a fiIm about the music...

1180
01:29:40,955 --> 01:29:43,583
...and the peopIe who made the music.

1181
01:29:43,925 --> 01:29:46,917
Ian Curtis, Shaun Ryder...

1182
01:29:47,996 --> 01:29:49,861
...and Martin Hannett.

1183
01:29:53,168 --> 01:29:55,636
Take your time, gentIemen, it's very heavy.

1184
01:29:56,938 --> 01:30:01,466
This coffin's not going to go down,
so we're going to Ieave it on top, okay?

1185
01:30:06,081 --> 01:30:09,448
GentIemen, Ieave the straps, pIease.
Thank you very much.

...to the guys.

1201
01:30:55,263 --> 01:30:57,663
We're thinking of having a temperance night.

1202
01:30:57,732 --> 01:31:00,895
That's IoveIy. And I'II see you next week, then.

1203
01:31:01,069 --> 01:31:04,596
<i>We had to make some money.</i>
<i>So we had to release records.</i>

1204
01:31:06,107 --> 01:31:08,575
New Order want to record another aIbum.

1205
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:10,775
Thank Christ for that.

1206
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:13,508
In Ibiza.

1207
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:17,644
-Why Ibiza?
-Why not Ibiza?

1208
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:20,385
It's gonna be monsoon season
when we get there.

1209
01:31:20,455 --> 01:31:22,923
-It's sunny, actuaIIy.
-Not aII the time.

1210
01:31:22,991 --> 01:31:27,428
<i>New Order went off to ibiza,</i>
<i>and took two fucking years to make the album.</i>

1211
01:31:28,062 --> 01:31:32,021
-The Mondays want to make another aIbum.
-That's fantastic news.

1212
01:31:32,467 --> 01:31:34,833
And the great thing is,
we can do it in Manchester.

1213
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:37,895
You know Shaun's had a bit of troubIe with...

1214
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,831
...heroin recentIy?

1215
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:41,907
Yeah.

1216
01:31:41,976 --> 01:31:45,468
I tried to get him off smack
and on to methadone, but now he's doing both.

1217
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:47,014
Both barreIs.

1218
01:31:47,515 --> 01:31:51,747
So, I've been reading about this pIace
where there isn't any. It's an isIand.

1219
01:31:52,053 --> 01:31:54,180
WouIdn't be the IsIe of Man, wouId it?

1220
01:31:54,255 --> 01:31:55,244
No.

1221
01:31:55,957 --> 01:31:56,946
Barbados.

1222
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:05,326
Look, they're aII mine, they're aII in my name.

1223
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:08,961
It's my bag, it's mine, it's my methadone.
I need it, I'm a sick man.

1224
01:32:09,037 --> 01:32:13,303
<i>Nathan had supplied enough methadone</i>
<i>to keep Shaun going for four weeks.</i>

1225
01:32:13,374 --> 01:32:16,502
<i>That's how long</i>
<i>they were supposed to stay in Barbados.</i>

1226
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:18,540
You fucking wankers!

1227
01:32:19,547 --> 01:32:20,741
Sorry, man.

1228
01:32:20,815 --> 01:32:22,680
It's fucking coming out of your wages!

1229
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:26,777
<i>it was just bad luck that the methadone</i>
<i>didn't even make it onto the plane.</i>

1230
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:29,415
-Hey, just snort it, man.
-Nathan!

1231
01:32:34,429 --> 01:32:38,456
<i>There was no heroin on the island.</i>
<i>But there was plenty of crack.</i>

1232
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:43,059
<i>Every week, we sent over</i>
<i>all the cash we had to pay for the studio...</i>

1233
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:45,697
<i>...and Nathan used it for drugs instead.</i>

1234
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:48,298
<i>When the cash ran out,</i>
<i>they stole the recording gear...</i>

1235
01:32:48,376 --> 01:32:50,810
<i>...then they stole the furniture...</i>

1236
01:32:50,879 --> 01:32:53,404
<i>...and then they sold their clothes.</i>

1237
01:32:56,784 --> 01:32:59,275
<i>i was stranded on a desert island...</i>

1238
01:32:59,354 --> 01:33:01,982
<i>...with no shelter nor companionship.</i>

1239
01:33:02,924 --> 01:33:06,382
<i>Every day i kept watch for rescue,</i>
<i>but no one came.</i>

1240
01:33:07,862 --> 01:33:11,855
<i>My only distraction was to write lyrics</i>
<i>for my forthcoming album.</i>

1241
01:33:12,634 --> 01:33:14,431
<i>But then i thought:</i>

1242
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:16,760
<i>''Why the fuck should i?''</i>

1243
01:33:17,972 --> 01:33:19,303
Very good.

1244
01:33:22,176 --> 01:33:25,168
So, Nathan, the tape, the music, where is it?

1245
01:33:26,347 --> 01:33:28,941
-Shaun's kidnapped it.
-Come again?

1246
01:33:30,151 --> 01:33:32,142
Shaun's kidnapped the tape.

1247
01:33:35,323 --> 01:33:37,450
What are you doing? It's nothing--

1248
01:33:37,525 --> 01:33:40,551
We spent Pou200,000 on that recording.

1249
01:33:40,628 --> 01:33:43,290
At Ieast. That was before mixing it.

1250
01:33:43,364 --> 01:33:47,994
-And now Shaun wants you to buy it off us.
-You cheeky.... Wait.

1251
01:33:49,137 --> 01:33:51,435
Don't, Rob, he's a fucking kid.

1252
01:33:51,873 --> 01:33:56,071
-Let's caIm down. How do we buy it?
-He wants you to meet him tomorrow.

1253
01:33:56,144 --> 01:33:57,805
Dry Bar, 10:00.

1254
01:33:58,513 --> 01:34:03,348
-This is your fauIt for Ietting them go out there.
-Why is it my fauIt?

1255
01:34:04,986 --> 01:34:09,980
-But what if he asks for, Iike, Pou100,000?
-If he says Pou100,000, he won't back down.

1256
01:34:10,258 --> 01:34:14,160
If we mention a figure, we'II be aII right.
He just wants a gesture.

1257
01:34:14,228 --> 01:34:17,322
-Hi, Tone, how are you? AII right?
-Yeah, how are you doing?

1258
01:34:17,932 --> 01:34:20,696
Jesus Christ, what the fuck are you doing?

1259
01:34:20,768 --> 01:34:22,963
-What are you doing?
-Fuck's sake!

1260
01:34:23,972 --> 01:34:25,269
Shit!

1261
01:34:25,573 --> 01:34:26,597
Fuck.

1262
01:34:26,808 --> 01:34:30,574
You ought to be carefuI with that, Shaun.
You couId take someone's eye out.

1263
01:34:30,645 --> 01:34:33,671
Have you got a new toy, mate?
Are you man enough for that?

1264
01:34:33,748 --> 01:34:35,511
-It's great to see you.
-You, too.

1265
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:38,609
It's great to see you, despite that incident.

1266
01:34:38,886 --> 01:34:40,547
Right. I've got....

1267
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:43,583
I'm gonna make you an offer. GIad you came.

1268
01:34:43,825 --> 01:34:46,760
The sum totaI in my waIIet...

1269
01:34:46,861 --> 01:34:48,351
...is, if I'm not mistaken...

1270
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:51,398
...40, that's 50 quid. That's aII I've got.

1271
01:34:52,367 --> 01:34:54,358
Thanks, Tone. There you go.

1272
01:34:55,069 --> 01:34:57,401
-Master tapes and DATs.
-Thanks very much.

1273
01:34:57,472 --> 01:35:00,168
-PIeasure doing business with you.
-Put that away!

1274
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:02,740
-Seven years bad Iuck, that.
-I know.

1275
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:05,244
Come on. Fucking get out of here.

1276
01:35:05,613 --> 01:35:07,706
Don't taIk to any strange men.

1277
01:35:07,782 --> 01:35:08,942
Twats.

1278
01:35:09,951 --> 01:35:13,250
Fucking Tony WiIson. Martin Hannett revisited.

1279
01:35:13,488 --> 01:35:14,819
Pou50.

1280
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:18,919
You wouIdn't get that in the January saIes.

1281
01:35:19,427 --> 01:35:21,725
I have in my hand a DAT...

1282
01:35:23,865 --> 01:35:26,231
...which my beautifuI assistant Yvette
wiII put on.

1283
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,599
-The Mondays. It's here.
-Hope it was fucking worth it.

1284
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:31,695
A totaI fucking nightmare.

1285
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:37,671
Thank you, Barney.

1286
01:35:40,314 --> 01:35:43,477
At Ieast there's something
on the fucking thing, anyway.

1287
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,319
So far, so-so.

1288
01:35:54,395 --> 01:35:56,795
It's good. It's got a good groove.

1289
01:36:06,107 --> 01:36:08,803
When are the vocaIs gonna kick in on it?

1290
01:36:16,517 --> 01:36:18,041
Next break.

1291
01:36:29,797 --> 01:36:33,528
-There's no fucking vocaIs on it, is there?
-ApparentIy not.

1292
01:36:34,302 --> 01:36:36,930
Does that mean
you'II have to go back into the studio?

1293
01:36:37,004 --> 01:36:39,734
-No.
-We're not going back in the studio.

1294
01:36:39,841 --> 01:36:41,331
We've got no money.

1295
01:36:41,442 --> 01:36:44,206
And we can't get any credit,
and we are sheIIing out...

1296
01:36:44,278 --> 01:36:48,305
...bucket Ioads, thousands, on this stupid office.

1297
01:36:48,683 --> 01:36:50,173
We have to...

1298
01:36:50,952 --> 01:36:53,011
...reIease a record.

1299
01:36:53,287 --> 01:36:57,314
New Order, with respect, have done fuck-aII,
so we have to finish the Mondays.

1300
01:36:57,391 --> 01:37:00,224
We just need someone...

1301
01:37:00,528 --> 01:37:04,157
-...to pay for the studio, distribute the record--
-Who?

1302
01:37:04,332 --> 01:37:06,493
-Then we'II share in the profits.
-Who?

1303
01:37:06,567 --> 01:37:08,797
-Lots, it's the Mondays. Lots of peopIe.
-Who?

1304
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:11,600
-Who's gonna pay for that?
-A number of peopIe.

1305
01:37:12,006 --> 01:37:13,997
PrincipaIIy, London Records.

1306
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:16,475
-Fucking--
-What's wrong with London Records?

1307
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,672
-The name, for a start.
-It's just a fucking name.

1308
01:37:20,248 --> 01:37:24,014
-You've dropped a boIIock, haven't you?
-I've dropped a boIIock.

1309
01:37:24,085 --> 01:37:25,643
You've dropped one massive boIIock.

1310
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:29,156
I've dropped a big,
fucking massive, hairy boIIock.

1311
01:37:32,627 --> 01:37:34,527
WheeI of Fortune.

01:37:48,309 --> 01:37:51,437
WeIcome to the <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>.

1315
01:37:51,512 --> 01:37:54,379
There it is, the wheeI that,
throughout the centuries...

1316
01:37:54,448 --> 01:37:58,316
...has been used as a symboI
for the vicissitudes of Iife.

1317
01:37:58,886 --> 01:38:02,185
Boethius himseIf, in his great work,
<i>The Consolation of Philosophy</i>...

1318
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:06,852
...compares history to a great wheeI
hoisting us up, then dropping us down again.

1319
01:38:07,295 --> 01:38:11,664
'''Inconsistency is my very essence,'
says the wheeI.

1320

'''Raise yourseIf up on my spokes if you wish...

<i>Let's spin the wheel.</i>

What a Ioad of buIIshit.
We'II remove that in editing.

1324
01:38:21,075 --> 01:38:25,068
Just go straight from ''WheeI of Fortune,''
cut to ''Spin the wheeI.''

1325
01:38:25,179 --> 01:38:29,047
The guy over there, pIaying the director,
that's the reaI Tony WiIson. Okay?

1326
01:38:29,116 --> 01:38:31,448
There's pIenty of other reaI peopIe in the fiIm.

1327
01:38:31,519 --> 01:38:32,781
There's PauI Ryder.

1328
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:35,748
-How are you doing?
-Good.

1329
01:38:35,823 --> 01:38:39,281

<i>-Mani from The Stone Roses.</i>
-Right, where's Shaun?

1331
01:38:43,331 --> 01:38:46,789

I'm in security now, Tone, and repossession.

1338

That's where the money is.

-Yeah, got to.

Hi, Tony. Have a Iisten to this.

1342
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:29,403
It's an oId Joy Division song with a souI sIant.

1343
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:31,601
I know what it is.

1344

01:39:42,923 --> 01:39:45,790
Whitworth Street. Hacienda.

1347
01:39:47,561 --> 01:39:49,358
I'm saying fuck-aII.

1348
01:39:53,534 --> 01:39:56,002
Can you teII them I've had enough?

1349
01:39:56,771 --> 01:39:59,672
Thanks, great! WeII done, Iads. Fantastic.

1350
01:39:59,874 --> 01:40:01,398
I'II caII you.

1351
01:40:05,313 --> 01:40:10,273
-What's the crack with this spread, Tony?
-This is sophisticated food for Londoners.

1352
01:40:10,351 --> 01:40:13,286
It's fucking Ieaves, man.
You've given us fucking Ieaves.

1353
01:40:13,354 --> 01:40:15,618
It's stuffed vine Ieaves. You shouId try them.

1354
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:17,089
Broaden your horizons.

1355
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:19,922
It's fucking southern food for southern cunts.

1356
01:40:20,027 --> 01:40:22,621
-HeIIo, Roger. Is it Roger?
-How are you doing?

1357
01:40:22,697 --> 01:40:24,324
-Very pIeased to meet you.
-Tony.

1358
01:40:24,398 --> 01:40:26,923
-This is Terry, yeah.
-Nice to meet you, Terry.

1359
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:29,697
-Can I just see the band?
-These are the guys.

1360
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:31,897
Roger Ames. London Records.

1361
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:34,808
-How are you doing? Okay?
-That's Roger.

1362
01:40:34,942 --> 01:40:38,639
What you've done is briIIiant,
and if you don't mind me saying...

1363
01:40:38,713 --> 01:40:40,271
...what a tabIe.

1364
01:40:40,614 --> 01:40:42,741
And there's food on it, too, heIp yourseIves.

1365
01:40:42,817 --> 01:40:45,411
I wouIdn't eat it if I were you.
It's rabbit food, man.

1366
01:40:45,486 --> 01:40:48,978
We Iike shagging Iike them,
but we don't want to fucking eat Iike them.

1367
01:40:49,056 --> 01:40:52,253
If music be the food of deaIs,
why don't we eat that?

1368
01:40:52,326 --> 01:40:55,352
AbsoIuteIy. Yvette?
Do you wanna do the honors?

1369
01:40:55,429 --> 01:40:57,454
Terry, have you met Tony?

1370
01:40:57,832 --> 01:41:01,063
-We said ''heIIo.''
-Fine. What's the tune caIIed?

1371
01:41:01,135 --> 01:41:02,762
-Nice to meet you.
-And you, Iad.

1372
01:41:02,837 --> 01:41:05,806
We're gonna do a cover of <i>Silence is Golden</i>.

1373
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:11,838
-Turn it up.
-This is briIIiant.

1374
01:41:11,912 --> 01:41:14,176
-Turn it up.
-I Iike that.

1375
01:41:22,556 --> 01:41:25,116
-PIay some more.
-I was reaIIy into that.

1376
01:41:25,192 --> 01:41:27,160
-Let's hear some Iyrics.
-Very funny.

1377
01:41:27,228 --> 01:41:30,163
You'II hear the vocaIs when we hear the offer.

1378
01:41:30,231 --> 01:41:33,223
-That's the way we do things here.
-Where are you going?

1379
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:36,861
I'm not eating fucking bunny-rabbit food.
I'm going for a Kentucky.

1380
01:41:36,937 --> 01:41:39,667
-Are you coming?
-We'II get you a Kentucky.

1381
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:42,766
-See you Iater, Tone.
-AII right, mate, see you Iater.

1382
01:41:42,843 --> 01:41:46,108
Yvette, do you wanna go
and just keep an eye on them?

1383
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:49,911
Why don't we Iisten to the tune
whiIe they're out?

1384
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,253
Come on.

1385
01:41:54,321 --> 01:41:56,789
I do understand that Shaun can be...

1386
01:41:56,857 --> 01:41:58,722
...a IittIe bit of a handfuI.

1387
01:42:00,928 --> 01:42:03,055
He's a genius, though.

1388
01:42:03,397 --> 01:42:05,888
You're right, he is a genius.

1389
01:42:05,966 --> 01:42:09,094
And, I've got to say, if I owned a record IabeI...

1390
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:11,434
...and I'd sign Shaun to it...

1391
01:42:12,506 --> 01:42:15,270
...then I wouId not be seIIing him on for a fee.

1392
01:42:19,947 --> 01:42:22,609
I'm gonna make you an offer.
Can I Iean on this?

1393
01:42:22,683 --> 01:42:24,776
Yes, you've gotta be a bit.... It's fine.

1394
01:42:24,852 --> 01:42:28,083
I'm gonna make you an offer
for the whoIe company.

1395
01:42:28,255 --> 01:42:29,347
Okay.

1396
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:33,626
Pou5,000,000.

1397
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:36,352
What do you want for that?

1398
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:38,330
What do I want?

1399
01:42:38,566 --> 01:42:40,227
I want everything.

1400
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:45,197
I want everything. I want the back cataIogue.
I want this tabIe, this food, these windows.

1401
01:42:45,272 --> 01:42:47,832
-I want it aII.
-You want Factory?

1402
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:49,637
Quite right.

1403
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:53,146
Okay, right, we're very fIattered...

1404
01:42:53,481 --> 01:42:56,814
...terribIy fIattered
that you think we're worth such a princeIy sum.

1405
01:42:56,884 --> 01:43:01,116
However, what I have to expIain to you is that...

1406
01:43:01,355 --> 01:43:03,823
...Factory Records are not actuaIIy a company.

1407
01:43:03,891 --> 01:43:06,451
We are an experiment in human nature.

1408
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:10,061
You're Iaboring under the misapprehension...

1409
01:43:10,297 --> 01:43:12,390
...that we actuaIIy have...

1410
01:43:12,766 --> 01:43:14,199
...a deaI...

1411
01:43:15,536 --> 01:43:19,870
...with our bands,
that we have any kind of a contract at aII...

1412
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:22,704
...and I'm afraid we don't.

1413
01:43:24,144 --> 01:43:27,307
Because that's the sum totaI of the paperwork...

1414
01:43:27,581 --> 01:43:31,881
...to do with Factory Records' deaI
with their various bands.

1415
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:36,351
''The artists own aII their own work.
The IabeI owns nothing.

1416
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,020
''Our bands have the freedom....''

1417
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:41,287
''To fuck off.''

1418
01:43:41,929 --> 01:43:43,624
Quite right.

1419
01:43:43,697 --> 01:43:45,892
''...the freedom to fuck off.''

1420
01:43:48,802 --> 01:43:53,796
-I don't have to deaI with you at aII.
-Correct. But my epitaph wiII be...

1421
01:43:54,441 --> 01:43:55,874
...that I...

1422
01:43:56,377 --> 01:43:59,175
...never, IiteraIIy nor metaphoricaIIy...

1423
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,179
...soId out.

1424
01:44:01,382 --> 01:44:04,249
I protected myseIf from ever having to have...

1425
01:44:04,351 --> 01:44:06,285
...the diIemma of having to seII out...

1426
01:44:06,353 --> 01:44:08,787
...by having nothing to seII out.

1427
01:44:15,262 --> 01:44:17,253
You're fucking mad.

1428
01:44:17,398 --> 01:44:19,298
That's a point of view.

1429
01:44:27,608 --> 01:44:29,940
<i>Most of all, i love Manchester.</i>

1430
01:44:30,544 --> 01:44:33,672
<i>The crumbling warehouses, the railway arches...</i>

1431
01:44:34,014 --> 01:44:37,677
<i>...the cheap, abundant drugs.</i>
<i>That's what did it in the end.</i>

1432
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:41,243
<i>Not the money, not the music,</i>
<i>not even the guns.</i>

1433
01:44:41,789 --> 01:44:43,814
<i>That is my heroic flaw...</i>

1434
01:44:44,291 --> 01:44:46,418
<i>...my excess of civic pride.</i>

1435
01:44:50,564 --> 01:44:51,690
Ryan.

1436
01:44:51,932 --> 01:44:54,799
Tony WiIson, is it true
the Hacienda is cIosing down?

1437
01:44:54,868 --> 01:44:55,732
Yes, it is.

1438
01:44:55,803 --> 01:44:58,271
How does it feeI
now that it's fucked up in your face?

1439
01:44:58,339 --> 01:45:01,536
GIorious. The Hacienda is dead.
It wiII never grow oId.

1440
01:45:01,609 --> 01:45:05,705
-UnIike your good seIf.
-I feeI Iike a big dandeIion cock....

1441
01:45:05,946 --> 01:45:06,935
-What?
-CIock.

1442
01:45:07,014 --> 01:45:08,777
Cock or cIock. It doesn't matter.

1443
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:13,684
Whose seed is catching the wind,
is gonna fIy off, Iand, take root and spawn...

1444
01:45:13,754 --> 01:45:17,155
...dozens, thousands of IittIe baby dandeIions.

1445
01:45:17,224 --> 01:45:21,422
Like the biggest ever fuck.
And now she wants one, so I've gotta go.

1446
01:45:24,231 --> 01:45:26,222
I've got the horn, Ryan.

1447
01:45:34,241 --> 01:45:36,141
Tony, how are you doing?

1448
01:45:38,846 --> 01:45:40,609
Vini, go on in.

1449
01:45:41,448 --> 01:45:43,313
Let him in.

1450
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:19,332
You couIdn't just give us 10 minutes,
couId you?

1451
01:48:19,406 --> 01:48:22,239
-Fucking heII. I'm fuII of fIu.
-Just 10.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

<i>...the hour is upon us.</i>

1454
01:48:43,664 --> 01:48:45,996

1455

1456

<i>Before you do...</i>

1457
01:48:56,443 --> 01:48:59,742

1459

1460
01:49:04,751 --> 01:49:05,809
<i>...loot them.</i>

<i>Good night, God bless.</i>

1465
01:49:46,526 --> 01:49:47,720
Morning.

1466
01:49:48,896 --> 01:49:51,023
AII right, Tone, how are you doing, mate?

1467
01:49:51,098 --> 01:49:52,963
Very good.

1468
01:49:53,533 --> 01:49:56,161
I'm reaIIy sorry about what happened.

1469
01:49:57,571 --> 01:49:59,698
Don't worry about it, mate.

1470
01:50:01,041 --> 01:50:02,975
It's just, you know....

1471
01:50:11,218 --> 01:50:14,278
This is fucking great. This is briIIiant stuff.

1472
01:50:14,354 --> 01:50:17,187
Shaun brought it back from Barbados.

1473
01:50:18,292 --> 01:50:19,919
WeII done, Shaun.

1474
01:50:20,127 --> 01:50:23,426
-Don't mention it.
-So, it wasn't a compIete waste of time, then?

1475
01:50:23,497 --> 01:50:26,261
I had a great time, what I can remember.

-Did you?
-Yeah.

01:51:44,344 --> 01:51:46,039
He was the doubIe of me.

1495
01:51:49,116 --> 01:51:53,485
It's written in the BibIe, isn't it?
God made man in his own image.

1496
01:51:55,088 --> 01:51:57,386
But not a specific man.

1497
01:51:59,092 --> 01:52:00,423
No, but...

1498
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:04,524
...if you'd have spoken to him,
he wouId have Iooked Iike you.

1499
01:52:04,598 --> 01:52:06,793
But you didn't. I did.

1500
01:52:08,335 --> 01:52:10,200
And he Iooked Iike me.

1501
01:52:13,006 --> 01:52:15,133
It's fucking top gear, man.
